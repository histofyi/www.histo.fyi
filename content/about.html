              <div class="vertical-spacing-bottom-0-25">
                  This is the beginning of an Open Science research project by Dr Chris Thorpe looking at the structure and function of MHC molecules and their associated peptides, receptors and accessory molecules.

                  One of the by-products of this research will be this site which will be an atlas of the 3D structures of these molecules, the peptides they bind and the receptors which recognise them, and how they all change three dimensionally through their interactions and through polymorphisms.

              <div class="vertical-spacing-bottom-0-25">
                  The long term goal of this work is to create systems which build automated high fidelity homology models of these complexes using machine learning, clustering, rule based systems and micro templates.

              <div class="vertical-spacing-bottom">
                It's also a mechanism for understanding in detail the thousands of structures which have been published over the last 25 years.

            <h2>Why histo.fyi?</h2>
              <div class="vertical-spacing-bottom-0-25">
                It's in hommage to the first website I was ever involved in with my PhD supervisor at Birkbeck College, <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/paul-travers" target="_new">Dr Paul Travers</a>. Histo was the name given to the Silicon Graphics Indigo on which we did our research in the early 1990s. It became the URL of the website histo.cryst.bbk.ac.uk.
              </div>
              <div class="vertical-spacing-bottom">
                That website was an information resource, as I hope this will be, hence the .fyi domain which seemed the most appropriate.

            <h2>What can be done with this information?</h2>
            <div class="vertical-spacing-bottom-0-25">
              Data analyses, supervised learning and machine learning all need clean, well labelled datasets. Since the earliest structures of MHC molecules were published, now over 30 years ago, there have been changes in nomenclature which make it hard to create groups of structures from search queries. In addition, within the structures, there are a variety of strategies used for assigning individual chains and in numbering individual residues. There are also now structures of MHC molecules with insertions and deletions. All of these things make it hard to create truly consistent multi-allele, multi-species datasets. For visual analyses the structures are in a variety of orientations, so a consistent method of alignment is needed.

            <div class="vertical-spacing-bottom">
              These datasets will be hopefully be useful for the wider structural and computational Immunology community, which is why they're being made openly available. A simple (and preliminary) example of the sort of analysis that can be done was presented as a poster at the <a href="/posters/2021/bsi">2021 British Society for Immunology Congress</a>.
