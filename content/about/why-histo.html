<div class="vertical-spacing-bottom-0-25">
    It's in hommage to the first website I was ever involved in with my PhD supervisor at Birkbeck College, <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/paul-travers" target="_new">Dr Paul Travers</a>. Histo was the name given to the Silicon Graphics Indigo on which we did our research in the early 1990s. It became the URL of the website histo.cryst.bbk.ac.uk.

    That website was an information resource, as I hope this will be, hence the .fyi domain which seemed the most appropriate.
