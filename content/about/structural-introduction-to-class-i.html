title:A structural introduction to MHC Class I molecules
---
<p>
    MHC (Major Histocompatibility Complex) Class I molecules bind a variety of peptides, conforming to a motif, in an antigen binding cleft and present them to T cells as part of the adaptive immune response.

    The MHC Class I Alpha chain requires a compatible peptide to fold with stability. The MHC:peptide complex is completed by Beta-2 microglobulin which is a single immunoglobulin domain which binds at an angle to the immunoglobulin Alpha 3 domain of the Class I Alpha chain and supports the curved sheet of the Alpha1/Alpha2 domain.

    Whilst the overall fold of this class of molecules is highly conserved, as demonstrated above, the antigen binding cleft is highly polymorphic and also exhibits a high degree of allostery/plasticity. Thus, different alleles can bind significantly different peptide repertoires, and there can even be diversity in the repertoire of an individual allele.

    Below we see a pair of images of slices through the binding cleft. The N-terminus of the peptide is on the left with the C-terminus on the right. The field of view has been shortened to just show the groove of the binding cleft. On the left is the human allele HLA-A2 which binds peptides with hydrophobic amino acids at <strong>P2</strong> (position 2) and <strong>PC</strong> (the C-terminal position). The cleft is quite shallow in the centre, with the middle "bulge" of the peptide arching over the amino acids in the cleft. In comparison, the mouse allele H2-Kb, which preferentially binds Tyrosines at <strong>P5</strong> in a deep pocket, but also binds a hydrophobic amino acid at <strong>PC</strong>. H2-Kb also prefers to bind octamer peptides (8 amino acids long), whereas HLA-A2 prefers binding nonamers (9 amino acids long).

<p>
    Despite this variability, in amino acids at specific anchors, and with the peptide length often being variable, there is considerable commonality and conservation in how the N- and C-terminii of the peptides are bound.
