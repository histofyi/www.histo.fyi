title:Why histo.fyi?
---
<p>
    It's in hommage to an early website built in 1993/1994 at Birkbeck College by <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/paul-travers" target="_blank">Dr Paul Travers</a> and <a href="/about/team#chris">Dr Chris Thorpe</a>. Histo was the name given to the Silicon Graphics Indigo on which the research was carried out in the early 1990s and it became the URL of the website histo.cryst.bbk.ac.uk.

    That website was an information resource, as this is, hence the .fyi domain which seemed the most appropriate.
