    The website is developed in <strong>Python</strong> using the  <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/" target="_new"><strong>Flask</strong></a> microframework, with  <a href="https://github.com/zappa/Zappa" target="_new"><strong>Zappa</strong></a> being used to host on  <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" target="_new"><strong>AWS Lambda</strong></a>. This allows it to scale up and down and consume as few resources as possible for cost and environmental reasons.
</p>
<p>
    Data is generated in a local pipeline and is queried as static  <a href="https://www.json.org/" target="_new"><strong>JSON</strong></a> objects persisted in  <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_new"><strong>AWS S3</strong></a>. This again requires no constantly running database instance and is a good fit for "Write infrequently, read often" applications. Structures are served out of S3 directly. The data for each release is available as Open Data from GitHub.

    The search is powered by <a href="https://www.algolia.com/" target="_new"><strong>Algolia</strong></a>, with data being posted to Algolia as the last step of the pipeline. Queries are pre-parsed to speed up the search and to use synonyms for outdated nomenclature.

    Analtics are provided by <a href="https://plausible.io/" target="_new"><strong>Plausible</strong></a> a "simple, lightweight, open source and privacy-first Google Analytics alternative". Custom analytics events are used for empty searches and page not found errors to help in product management.
