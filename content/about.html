                  This is the beginning of an Open Science research project by Dr Chris Thorpe looking at the structure and function of MHC molecules and their associated peptides, receptors and accessory molecules.

                  One of the by-products of this research will be this site which will be an atlas of the 3D structures of these molecules and how they, the peptides they bind and the receptors which recognise them change three dimensionally through their interactions and through polymorphisms.

                  The long term goal of this work is to create systems which build automated high fidelity homology models of these complexes using machine learning, clustering, rule based systems and micro templates.

              <h2>Why histo.fyi?</h2>

                It's in hommage to the first website I was ever involved in with my PhD supervisor at Birkbeck College, <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/paul-travers" target="_new">Dr Paul Travers</a>. Histo was the name given to the Silicon Graphics Indigo on which we did our research in the early 1990s. It became the URL of the website histo.cryst.bbk.ac.uk.

              <div class="vertical-spacing-bottom-0-25">
                That website was an information resource, as I hope this will be, hence the .fyi domain which seemed the most appropriate.
