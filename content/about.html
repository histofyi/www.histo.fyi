title:About <strong>histo.fyi</strong>
---
<p>
    <strong>histo.fyi</strong> is a website/database containing 3D structures and associated information about Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class I molecules which is updated on a monthly basis through an automated curation pipeline. All structures contained within the database are publicly available from the Protein Data Bank (PDB).
</p>
<p>
    The website/database aims to provide machine/human-readable data to help understand these molecules, their interaction with the antigen they present, and the receptors that recognise/bind them.
</p>
<p>
    The website/database is designed around the needs of three main audiences:
    <ul>
        <li>Structural biologists who are interested in adaptive immunity.</li>
        <li>Immunologists who are interested in structural biology.</li>
        <li>Computational biologists/machine learning practitioners who are interesed in codifying/predicting elements of MHC:peptide:receptor interactions.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    The website/database is designed to be a companion to databases about T-cell receptor structure such as <a href="http://opig.stats.ox.ac.uk/webapps/stcrdab/" target="_blank">STCRDab</a> from the <a href="http://opig.stats.ox.ac.uk/"  target="_blank">Oxford Protein Informatics Group</a> [<a href="https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/46/D1/D406/4566020" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkx971</a>] and <a href="https://tcr3d.ibbr.umd.edu/tcr_com" target="_blank">TCR3d</a> from the <a href="https://bmblab.org/" target="_blank">Baker</a>/<a href="https://piercelab.ibbr.umd.edu/" target="_blank">Pierce</a> labs at the University of Notre Dame [<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/prot.25829" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1002/prot.25829</a>].
