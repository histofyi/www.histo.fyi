<p>
    Data analyses, supervised learning and machine learning all need clean, well labelled datasets. Since the earliest structures of MHC molecules were published, now over 30 years ago, there have been changes in nomenclature which make it hard to create groups of structures from search queries. In addition, within the structures, there are a variety of strategies used for assigning individual chains and in numbering individual residues. There are also now structures of MHC molecules with insertions and deletions. All of these things make it hard to create truly consistent multi-allele, multi-species datasets. For visual analyses the structures are in a variety of orientations, so a consistent method of alignment is needed.
